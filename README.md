## tidycps

__tidycps__ is an R package that allows users to interface with the US Census' Current Population Survey (CPS) basic monthly microdata, and return tidyverse-ready data frames. 

This package is still in the early stages of development, but can be used to retive basic monthly CPS microdata. When I am happy with the development stage I will post version 1 on CRAN. For now, install from GitHub for the latest updates.
